            <h2> My Favourite Hobbies: <br> <span id="name"> Coding And Solving Puzzles! </span> </h2>
        </div>
        <p id="solvingpuzzles"> Solving Puzzles is one of my favourite things to do when I'm Bored. As a little kid I always wondered how to solve a cube with 6 different colors. I always bought a 3x3 Cube but I was unable to solve it. That was until I saw my friend do it, who was younger to me by a couple of months. So after that I watched tutorials on youtube and now I can solve the 3x3 cube under 30 seconds....... I thought to myself if I can solve this cube, than I can solve many other cubes. After that I started learning to solve a 4x4 and then a 5x5 after that a 6x6 and 7x7. I even solved shape changing cubes like the Square-1 and Mirror Cubes. I also starting solving Jigsaw Puzzles. My highest score of solving a puzzle with the most peices is 500! </p>

        <p id="coding"> Coding! I never really knew much about coding. I was exposed to the world of coding when my best friend suggested me about it. I got to know that coding was the reason why people could make wep pages. I first started of by doing block coding, and moving on I started learning about HTML which means Hyper Text Markup Language. Now I make web pages using HTML. There are 3 Main stages while doin HTML. Step1: Do the Coding for HTML; Step2: Do the Coding for CSS and last but not the least Step3: Do the Coding for JS. Now if you're wondering what CSS and JS is well they are actually parts of HTML, which stand for Cascading Style Sheets and Java Script respectively. Well that's how I started loving coding. Now even if I want, I can also create my own game. </p>

        <h2> Lately I have been doing a lot of Card Tricks, and trying to fool people. I have a Deck of Cards through which I do Magic with it and I have also been teaching my brother some magic. I have a Card Trick that will let people into thinking that whatever card they pick from the Deck of Cards. I somehow mange to flip that card from the middle of the deck and show them that it's magic. It's my dream to One Day go to One of the Biggest Stages in the World, The AGT (America's Got Talent). </h2>

        <h3 id="xbox"> Oooh..... Yess! Playing X-Box has got to be the best thing I do while I'm free. PLaying Video Games helps me enjoy my time the Best, even though I do Rage sometimes when I'm playing the game bad!!! One of my Favourite Games to Play on X-Box is Fortnite (Not 15 Days), it's a Battle Royal Game, It's my favourite game because I have a lot of freinds across the globe who can talk to me and play with them anytime. Fortnite has different Game Modes in which you can create your own world's or maps, even deathrun's. Me and my brother made an Easy 10 Level Deathrun, we aren't able to figure out how to publish it. But we'll soon figure it out. It also has different live events on different times and on special occassion which are really Cool! Here are some of those Events. Check these out: </h3>

        <h2> I don't have any Idol or any Famous Person who inspired me to become who I want to. It was always my parents who were my inspiration. Whenever I thought I was not going to be able to do something or even give up sometimes. It was always my mother who would support me to have faith in myself and whenever I would not be able to understand anything in Maths or science or any other subject. My dad would always sit with me and teach me each and every single concept slowly and wait for me to understand it. When I slowly started growing older my father and mother told me to become an IAS Officer (Indian Administrative Service). It was a hard job not evrybody could get it but just like always my mom says, that nothing is impossible in life, So I would give my best to become an IAS officer. </h2>
